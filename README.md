## Background
My name is Wayne Lightfoot, I am 30 years old from Perth WA. I am married and have an overly energetic 2 year old boy. I am currently working as an electrician in the building and construction industry and have been for 13 years. My life evolves around my family but I have a passion for AFL football and cricket. Unfortunatly due to previous knee reconstructions and surgeries it has limited and shutdown my football career. I still enjoy helping out at my local club by managing one of the teams.


## Interest in IT

I have always had an interest in IT but in my younger age, I spent most of my time invested in sporting activities. Now with my body not as able as before I've begun to spend more time behind a screen and become curious about how the internet, programs and applications, all come to be. My experience is limited, I completed BIT (Business Information Technology) subject in high school and set up switches, comms racks through my work for homes and businesses. I see IT guys come in and program rooms and areas I’ve wired and found their work so much more intriguing. I chose RMIT to complete a Bachelor of IT and learn these skills and expand my knowledge in a more challenging and rewarding field.

## Ideal Job
The ideal job for me at this time is a business IT analyst as it I know its an important position and it matches my desire to learn more about how businesses are run and the importance of IT to create a successful business. I want to be the problem solver of the gap between business problems and technology solutions. I will assist businesses with storing documentation and providing systems that integrates technology into their works and provide easier solutions to function and thrive as a business.
#### Job Requirements
-Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and/or Commerce or a relevant discipline 

-Experience performing complex analytical and problem-solving activities

-Experience with typical networking and data storage infostructure and operating systems

-Experience in business process mapping and process redesign
#### Plan 
My experience and skills are limited as I am now just beginning my IT path. I plan to obtain these skills throughout my Bachelor of IT at RMIT university. My progress may be slow at times due to present work situations or family commitments but I am driven to excel and be apart of this IT world. I also plan to gain an internship through family contacts as i progress to gain further knowledge.

## Personal Profile
Personal Online Tests are a way of finding out a persons traits or personality. Ive attached 3 results of online tests about myself.
I found the results interesting knowing what my strengths and weaknesses are when it comes to learning and how i apprroach certain situations. It can be beneficial in a team exercise by knowing my traits, so i can then work towards the certain tasks that i will be more likely to excel at and be a more productive member for the team.
